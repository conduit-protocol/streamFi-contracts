# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here. Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `force_cancel()` on `DripStream` — recipient can settle atomically after sender leaves stream paused for more than 30 days (`PauseThresholdNotMet` error returned if threshold not met)
- `PauseThresholdNotMet` error code (13) added to `Error` enum

### Changed
- `get_escrow_for_user` visibility scoped; bare `get_escrow` now `pub(crate)` only
- `DripFactory::create_stream` now cross-contract-calls `DripGovernor::config()` and enforces `max_rate_per_second`/`min_duration_seconds`; `protocol_fee_bps()` reads `fee_bps` live from the governor instead of returning a hardcoded stub
- `DripFactory::upgrade_stream_wasm` now returns `Result<(), Error>` instead of panicking when the factory isn't initialized

### Fixed
- **Empty streams.** `DripStream::initialize` did not validate its amount parameter, so a stream deployed directly (ADR-001: each stream is an independent contract, deployable without the factory) could be initialized with a zero or negative `rate_per_second`, creating an "empty stream" that escrows tokens but never releases any. It now rejects `rate_per_second <= 0` with the existing `InvalidAmount` error, failing early before any state is written.
- **`DripFactory::create_stream` fails early on invalid input.** Amount/validation checks (`deposit > 0`, `rate_per_sec > 0`, funding, time range, governor bounds) now run before any state mutation — previously the instance TTL was bumped even for calls that were about to be rejected, so an empty-stream attempt (`deposit <= 0`) still touched storage. `initialize()` had no auth check and no "already initialized" guard on `DripStream`, `DripFactory`, and `DripGovernor` — anyone could call it again post-deployment to hijack a funded stream's sender/recipient, the factory's stream WASM hash/governor address, or the governor's authority. All three now reject a second `initialize()` call with a new `AlreadyInitialized` error.
- **Non-positive `withdraw`/`top_up` amounts.** Neither validated `amount > 0`; a negative `amount` in `withdraw` could shrink the stored `Withdrawn` total. Both now return `InvalidAmount` for `amount <= 0`.
- **Deposit not validated against full stream duration** (Known Limitation #4) — `create_stream` now requires `deposit >= rate_per_sec * (end_time - start_time)` for fixed-duration streams.
- **Missing TTL management** (Known Limitation #1) — every state-mutating call on all three contracts now extends instance TTL (and, on the factory, the `BySender`/`ByRecipient` persistent indices), matching the extension already applied to `StreamAddr`.
- `paginate()` in `DripFactory` could panic on `offset + limit` overflow; now uses `saturating_add`.
- `DripFactory::create_stream`/`upgrade_stream_wasm` panicked via `unwrap()`/`expect()` before `initialize()` instead of returning the already-defined `NotInitialized` error.

### Security
- Documented pause-state griefing attack vector in `docs/security.md` (ADR-003 records the fix design)
- Committed `Cargo.lock` for reproducible builds (previously gitignored)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- `upgrade_stream_wasm()` on `DripFactory` — governor-gated WASM hash update for deployed stream contracts
- `streamed_total()` view on `DripStream` — returns gross streamed amount (before withdrawal subtraction) for UI display
- `transfer_recipient()` on `DripStream` — recipient can reassign stream rights to a new address; emits `xfer_rec` event
- ADR-003: Recipient transfer without sender veto

### Fixed
- `DripFactory`: extend persistent storage TTL on `StreamAddr` entries to prevent ledger pruning on long-lived streams
- `math.rs`: use `saturating_sub` in `withdrawable()` to guard against `withdrawn > streamed` edge case on rapid successive withdrawals

### Tests
- 9 additional unit tests in `stream/src/tests.rs`: cancelled state, pause-then-cancel, `info()` struct fields, sequential withdrawals, edge cases
- Full integration test suite: `stream_lifecycle`, `stream_pause_resume`, `stream_clawback`, `factory_deploy`, `governor_config`

### CI
- Split unit and integration test steps in `ci.yml`
- Added WASM `clippy` pass to catch `no_std` incompatibilities
- Report WASM artifact sizes on each build
