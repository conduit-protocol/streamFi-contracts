///
/// - the all-zero Ed25519 account (`G...` strkey `GAAAA...AWHF`), and
/// - the all-zero Soroban contract address (`C...` strkey `CAAAA...BSC4`).

/// Both literals are hardcoded here once so every contract sharing this
/// helper uses the exact same values — a duplicated copy would be easy to
/// typo differently without anyone noticing. The account form is checked
/// first since it is the more common case, so a real account address never
/// pays for parsing the contract literal.
