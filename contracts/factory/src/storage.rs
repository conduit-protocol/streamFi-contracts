use soroban_sdk::{contracttype, Address};

/// Storage keys for the DripFactory contract.
///
/// The `#[contracttype]` macro serializes each variant as an XDR tagged union:
/// the discriminant (variant index) followed by the encoded inner type. This
/// means `DataKey::StreamAddr(42)` and `DataKey::StreamAddr(43)` are distinct
/// keys in Soroban's storage trie, each serialized as:
///   [discriminant: u32][stream_id: u64]
///
/// Similarly, `DataKey::BySender(address)` serializes as:
///   [discriminant: u32][address: XDR-encoded Address]
///
/// Storage is split across two tiers:
/// - **Instance storage**: Small, contract-scoped data that scales with the
///   number of operations (e.g., counters, config). Bounded by instance size limits.
/// - **Persistent storage**: Per-entity data that grows without bound (e.g.,
///   per-stream addresses, per-user indices). Avoids hitting instance size limits
///   as the protocol scales. Each entry has its own TTL and can be extended independently.
