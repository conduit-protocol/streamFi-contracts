 *    as `events[events.length - 1].ledger` when `nextToken === null`.
 * 2. `lastLedger` is the **inclusive** upper ledger that was scanned to
 *    produce this page (the `endLedger` the caller passed, clamped to the
 *    latest closed ledger). Example: request `startLedger=100, endLedger=200`
 *    may return `lastLedger=200` even if the last event was at 195 — 200 is
 *    still the scanned high-water mark and the next query starts at 201.
 * 3. `nextToken === null` means the range `[startLedger, lastLedger]` is
 *    fully exhausted. `nextToken !== null` means at least one more page
 *    remains for the **same** range — the caller must re-invoke with
 *    `cursor: nextToken` and the **same** `startLedger`/`endLedger`.
 * 4. An empty `events` array with `nextToken === null` is valid (no events

 *
 * ### `created` — `DripStream::created` (`stream/src/events.rs:created`)
 * Topics: `("created", sender, sequence)` — sender is the stream creator.
 * ```
 * fields: {
 *   recipient: string;        // G... Stellar address
 *   token: string;            // G... SAC address
 *   rate_per_second: string;  // i128 decimal string, > 0

 * Topics: `("withdrawn", recipient, sequence)`
 * ```
 * fields: {
 *   amount: string;          // i128 decimal string, > 0
 *   total_withdrawn: string; // i128 decimal string, cumulative
 *   remaining: string;       // i128 decimal string, vault remainder
 *   sequence: number;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### `cancelled` — `DripStream::cancelled` (sender/operator via `cancel`)
 * Topics: `("cancelled", sender, sequence)`
 * ```
 * fields: {
 *   refund_amount: string;    // i128 — returned to sender
 *   withdrawn_so_far: string; // i128 — already withdrawn by recipient
 *   sequence: number;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### `force_cxl` — `DripStream::force_cancelled` (recipient-only, 30d after pause)
 * Same fields as `cancelled` but distinct `type` so consumers don't need to
 * correlate the transaction signer to tell sender-cancel apart from
 * recipient force-cancel.
 * ```
 * fields: { refund_amount: string; withdrawn_so_far: string; sequence: number; }
 * ```
 *
 * ### `paused` — `DripStream::paused`
 * Topics: `("paused", sender, sequence)`

 * fields: {
 *   paused_at: number;   // u64 ledger timestamp
 *   withdrawable: string; // i128 — amount that was withdrawable at pause time
 *   sequence: number;
 * }

 *
 * ### `resumed` — `DripStream::resumed`
 * Topics: `("resumed", sender, sequence)`
 * ```
 * fields: { resumed_at: number; sequence: number; }
 * ```
 *
 * ### `topped_up` — `DripStream::topped_up`
 * Topics: `("topped_up", sender, sequence)`
 * ```
 * fields: { amount: string; new_balance: string; sequence: number; }

 *
 * ### `clawback` — `DripStream::clawback`
 * Topics: `("clawback", sender, sequence)`
 * ```
 * fields: { amount: string; sequence: number; }
 * ```
 *
 * ### `xfer_rec` — `DripStream::recipient_transferred`
 * Topics: `("xfer_rec", old_recipient, sequence)` — old recipient in topic,
 * new recipient in data (sole data field).
 * ```
 * fields: { new_recipient: string; sequence: number; }
 * ```
 *
 * ### `set_op` — `DripStream::operator_set`
 * Topics: `("set_op", sender, sequence)`
 * ```
 * fields: { operator: string; sequence: number; }
 * ```
 *
 * ### `rm_op` — `DripStream::operator_revoked`
 * Topics: `("rm_op", sender)` — note: sequence is the **data**, not a topic
 * (see `stream/src/events.rs:operator_revoked`). Fold must handle both.
 * ```
 * fields: { sequence: number; }
 * ```
 *
 * ### `factory_paused` / `factory_unpaused` — `DripFactory::pause` / `unpause`
 * Topics: `("paused", governor)` / `("unpaused", governor)` — no sequence.
 * ```
 * fields: { at: number; } // paused_at / resumed_at ledger timestamp
